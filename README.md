# Recipes App 🍔

<h3> An app for storing different recipes, with ingredients, number of servings, date added and preparation instructions. </h3>
<br/>
Recipes are sorted into categories: desserts, breakfast, main course meals, etc.
<br/>
If a category doesn't exist, it can be added.
<br/>
Recipes can be searched by name and/or filtered by category.
<br/>
There is an option to add new recipes and edit existing ones.
